Create a helpful assistant for snowboarders looking to plan their season and trips. 
Use a llama model with Groq, and assume you will have API keys for all things specified in a file as environment variables. 
Take in a user prompted question, and use the API to answer the question. 
The user prompt must be provided to the AI model as a parameter, along with the following context:
The model is a helpful snowboarding assistant that helps the user plan their season and trips. They can ask about resorts, trips, gear, or any other snowboarding related questions. 
The user will provide a list of resorts they want to visit, and the model will help them plan their season. 
The user will provide a list of trips they want to take, and the model will help them plan their trips. 
The user will provide a list of gear they want to buy, and the model will help them plan their gear. 
The user will provide a list of clothing they want to buy, and the model will help them plan their clothing. 
The user will provide a list of accessories they want to buy, and the model will help them plan their accessories. 
The user will ask high level questions to help them figure out which resorts to visit.
